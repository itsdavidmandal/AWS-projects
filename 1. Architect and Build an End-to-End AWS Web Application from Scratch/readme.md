# Project Title : 
Architect and Build an End-to-End AWS Web Application from Scratch

# Project Description: 
This project is a simple web application that calculates an exponent â€” given a base number and an exponent, it returns the result (base^exponent). While the functionality is intentionally minimal, the purpose of the project is to demonstrate how different AWS services can be tied together into a complete, shareable, end-to-end application.

The app showcases how to:
- Host a static website with AWS Amplify,
- Expose a serverless API through API Gateway,
- Run backend logic with AWS Lambda (Python),
- Persist data in a DynamoDB NoSQL database, and
- Manage secure access with IAM permissions.

# Prerequisites
- AWS account with console access.
- Basic AWS knowledge (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB).
- Text editor (VS Code, Notepad++).
- Python 3.9+ (for Lambda).
- Zip utility (to compress HTML for Amplify).

# Step-by-Step Guide: 

## Create and host the web page:

- Create a simple `"index.html"` file with the following code : 
![alt text](../1.%20Architect%20and%20Build%20an%20End-to-End%20AWS%20Web%20Application%20from%20Scratch/images/index.html.png)

- Zip the file
