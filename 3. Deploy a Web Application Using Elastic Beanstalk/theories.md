# AWS Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a cloud service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale web applications and services without needing to deal with the underlying infrastructure. Developers simply upload their application code, and Beanstalk automatically handles tasks like provisioning servers, load balancing, scaling, and monitoring. 

# Beanstalk vs EC2

**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** provides raw virtual servers in the cloud, giving users full control over the operating system, software, networking, and security. It is flexible but requires manual setup, configuration, and scaling.EC2 is best for users who want maximum control over infrastructure. <br><br>
**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that runs on top of EC2 and automates much of the heavy lifting. With Beanstalk, developers just upload their code, and AWS handles provisioning EC2 instances, load balancing, auto-scaling, and monitoring. Beanstalk is best for developers who prefer focusing on application code and letting AWS manage the environment.

# Applications in Beanstalk : 

An application in AWS Elastic Beanstalk is the top-level container that holds all the resources and configurations related to a project. It serves as an organizational unit that groups together the application versions (different uploaded code packages), environments (where the app runs), and saved configurations.

# Environments , Saved Configurations and Application Versions in Beanstalk

**Environment** is a collection of AWS resources (like EC2 instances, load balancers, and databases) that run a specific version of an application; you can have multiple environments such as “development,” “testing,” and “production” for the same app. <br> **Saved configurations** are reusable templates of environment settings (like instance type, scaling rules, and security groups) that can be applied when creating new environments, ensuring consistency and saving time.<br> **Application versions** represent specific, uploaded iterations of your application code (stored in Amazon S3), allowing you to deploy, roll back, or test different versions of your app easily within an environment.
