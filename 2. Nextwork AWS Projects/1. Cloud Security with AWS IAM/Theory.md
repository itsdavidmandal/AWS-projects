# EC2 : 

Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (AWS EC2) is a cloud service that provides scalable virtual servers, known as instances, for running applications and workloads. Instead of buying physical hardware, users can quickly launch and manage these virtual machines with varying configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking to suit different needs.

Here's what the three words mean:
1️⃣ Elastic = flexible. This service can easily adapt and change in size and power to fit your needs.
2️⃣ Compute = computing power. EC2 provides virtual computers that can do various tasks, just like your personal computer.
3️⃣ Cloud = available over the internet.
