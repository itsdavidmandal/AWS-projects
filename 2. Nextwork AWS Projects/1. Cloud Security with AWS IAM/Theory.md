# EC2 : 

Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (AWS EC2) is a cloud service that provides scalable virtual servers, known as instances, for running applications and workloads. Instead of buying physical hardware, users can quickly launch and manage these virtual machines with varying configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking to suit different needs.

Here's what the three words mean: <br>
1️⃣ Elastic = flexible. This service can easily adapt and change in size and power to fit your needs.<br>
2️⃣ Compute = computing power. EC2 provides virtual computers that can do various tasks, just like your personal computer.<br>
3️⃣ Cloud = available over the internet.<br>

#  EC2 instances : 

EC2 instances are the virtual servers that run on Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) platform. Each instance acts like a traditional server but is hosted in the cloud, giving users the flexibility to choose hardware configurations such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity based on their application needs.

# AMI : 

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a preconfigured template provided by AWS that contains the operating system, application server, and applications needed to launch an EC2 instance. It serves as the blueprint for creating instances, ensuring consistency and saving time when deploying multiple servers with the same setup.

# Prod and dev environment : 

## Prod environment : 

It the live system where the application is deployed for real users, handling actual data and business operations. Production environments prioritize stability, security, and performance, with strict change controls to minimize downtime or errors. 

## Dev environment

A development (dev) environment and a production (prod) environment serve different purposes in the software lifecycle. The dev environment is where developers build, test, and experiment with code, often using mock data and tools that allow frequent changes without affecting end users. It is designed to be flexible, enabling debugging, feature testing, and rapid iteration.
